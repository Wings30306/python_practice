This document was created using the w+ mBOO!d
The cursor was in position 45 when this text was added.
The cursor was in position 104 when this line was added. But what happens when I put the cursor at position 40 and type 'BOO!'?

code used in the python terminal:

>>> f = open("challenge_one.txt", "w+")
>>> f.write("This document was created using the w+ method")
45
>>> f.tell()
45
>>> f.write("\nThe cursor was in position 45 when this text was added.\n")
57
>>> f.tell()
104
>>> f.write("The cursor was in position 104 when this line was added. But what happens when I put the cursor at position 40 and
type 'BOO!'?")
127
>>> f.seek(40)
40
>>> f.write("BOO!")

>>> f.close()
